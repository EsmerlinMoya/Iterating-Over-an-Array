Iterating Over an Array


LOOPS AND FUNCTIONS
Functions are a convenient way to package functionality into reusable components. You can add any code into a function, including loops.
Say for example you want to know how many of your friends got over 70 in their recent exam.
You first create an array of their grades and pass that array to a function. That function iterates through the array and maintains a count of how many grades were above 70, and returns that value.
